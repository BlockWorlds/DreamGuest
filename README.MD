<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<b>PermissionsEx</b><br>
This plugin uses PEX functions that Vault does not provide. I will try to move this dependency over to Vault in the future.

<h2>Commands</h2>

<h3>/who</h3>
<b>Permission node:</b> <code>dreamguest.chat.who</code> <br>
<b>Usage: </b> /who <br>
<b>Description: </b> lists all currently online players, sorted by group. Groups are sorted by weight, ascending. If a group does not yet have a weight assigned when this command is run, it gets assigned a weight of one less than the previously lowest weight. <br>

<h3>/kick</h3>
<b>Permission node:</b> <code>dreamguest.admin.kick</code> <br>
<b>Usage: </b> /kick &lt;target&gt; [reason] <br>
<b>Description: </b> kicks the targeted player from the server. If no reason is provided, the default reason is used (from config.yml) <br>

<h3>/ban</h3>
<b>Permission node:</b> <code>dreamguest.admin.ban</code> <br>
<b>Usage: </b> /ban &lt;target&gt; [reason] <br>
<b>Description: </b> bans the targeted player from the server. If no reason is provided, the default reason is used (from config.yml). &lt;target&gt; can be either the name of the player or his UUID. If a player is offline, provide the exact player name for him to be banned. Uses default reason if none is provided.
 
<h3>/unban</h3>
<b>Permission node:</b> <code>dreamguest.admin.unban</code> <br>
<b>Usage: </b> /unban &lt;target&gt; <br>

<b>Description: </b> retrieves the reason the targeted player was baned for. &lt;target&gt; can be either name or UUID, name must be exact.<br>

<h3>/afk</h3>
<b>Permission node:</b> <code>dreamguest.chat.afk</code> <br>
<b>Usage: </b> /afk [message] <br>
<b>Description: </b> Sets the player as afk. If no message is specified, it will either be replaced by the default message (if <code>random-afk-messages</code> is set to false), or by a random message from a set list (if <code>random-afk-messages</code> is set to true).<br>

<h3>/addafkmessage</h3>
<b>Permission node:</b> <code>dreamguest.chat.addafkmessage</code> <br>

<h3>/vanish</h3>
<b>Permission node:</b> <code>dreamguest.admin.vanish</code> <br>
<b>Usage: </b> /vanish [target] <br>
<b>Description: </b> Vanishes the targeted player, hiding him from people without the <code>dreamguest.admin.vanish</code> permission. Leave target blank to target yourself.<br>
